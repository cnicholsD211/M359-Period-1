           the first character, the second line shows the second character, and so on

               m
               mo
               mon

        // create a new String, or modify the existing String, that removes
        // the word "little" entirely



        // create a new String (based on phrase), or modify the existing String,
        // that replaces the word "little" with the word "BIG"
